Carrot Gatherer
In this game made with Pygame, you spawn as a bunny and make your way through randomly generated maps with increasing sizes. You gather carrots and live your best life. But there is a slight difficulty - the time is limited, and so are your moves per map. Try beating your friends in the ranking and see who is thinking faster!

This game covers:
- The goal of the game is to get the highest score possible by quickly passing through maps and collecting carrots.
- The map is always randomly generated based on dimensions (e.g., 3x3, 5x5, etc.). The player, the 'home' (portal to the next level), and carrots will also spawn randomly. The game itself is chess-like but only with one movable figure.
- The player can move to 8 positions around them (or less if they reach the edge of the map).
- The player cannot move off the screen.
- The player can run out of moves and die. When you go to the next map, the moves recalculate according to its size.
- The game has 2 endings. The bad one occurs when you die, and your only option is to start again. The other ending is when you survive for the given time, and your score is written to a file for later use. In this case, you will see a table of the top 3 players and their scores.
- You can replay the game as much as you want.
- There is music and basic sound effects.

This game doesn't cover:
- There is no fully resizable UI, although many elements respond to different window sizes.
- There are no enemies that can attack you except your own rash decisions.
- There are no endings besides running out of time/moves.
